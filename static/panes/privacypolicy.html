<p>We think that privacy is the main priviledge of our users. That means, we (IRC Operators) never eavesdrop (nor we have ability to) or join private channels or conversations. For our users, we provide high level of privacy: </p>

<li> All servers in the network are using a military-grade cipher when linking with one another, so nobody can get your conversation from a flow of packets between our services </li>
<li> We provide and highly encourage you to use SSL services, that like above, allow you to protect your conversation from outside. </li>
<li> For our webusers, we also provide SSL webchats, you can find links on the servers page. </li>
<li> That means, if you connect using SSL (no matter if webchat or not) and chat with another person, or a group of people, where everyone is using encrypted connection, you can be sure no one from outside can see your conversation (unless it leaks someway ;) </li>
<li> Your IP address is by default masked. People can see part of your hostname, eg. instead of 123-45-67-89.dyn.iinet.net.au they see irc-mq37g7.iinet.net.au. The mask is constant for any hostname, but it can't lead anybody to a real address.</li>
